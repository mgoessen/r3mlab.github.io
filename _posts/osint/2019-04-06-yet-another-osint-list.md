Although OSINT is not about finding the magical tool, I find useful to keep my own list of tools & resources for reference and to get ideas when I’m stuck.

If you are a beginner with open-source intelligence, rushing to the tools is tempting, but I advise you to do some research on the technical side of things to make sure you understand what a tool does, what information it provides you, how accurate or actionable might this information be, etc.

E.g. : Before rushing to the “breached data” section, you should get familiar with what a databreach is, how they happen, where stuff usually leak, what MD5 & SHA1 hashes are, and so on.

You can explore the list on its [Github repository](https://github.com/r3mlab/datajournalism-resources/blob/master/README.md), contributions & feedback welcome!
